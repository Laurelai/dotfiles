plugin: http://s3.amazonaws.com/mps/slime.vim

Thankfully, I can help with the automation. Get slime.vim and put it in ~/.vim/plugin/ .

A few notes:

the magic key is C-c C-c (like Slime, surprise!)
the first time, you’ll be prompted for the “session name” and the “window name”
subsequent times will be automated
you can reprompt for “session name” and “window name” with C-c v
by default, C-c C-c will select the current paragraph and copy-paste it
but you can make your own selection first, and send it over with C-c C-c
